# Forking Guide

Thanks for coming here.

## Step 1 : License (You may be thinking let's skip this - but don't)

#### Note: Never ever do a Replace All while forking any Open Source Project. If you are found doing this, A DMCA takedown notice will be issued immediately.

Add the following line **below** the license header **only** for the files you
edit on your own without copying. If copied please add the source (URL,
reference books etc.) and the copyright holder name to the below line.

```
// Copyright (c) 2018, <Name of the Copyright Holder>.
```

## Step 2 : Changing Values

This project is designed to be very easy to fork. All you have to do is change
the values present in `lib/fork/` directory and that's it
